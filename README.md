# FishTech
T5-Bootcamp  - Capstone Project  
# Abstact
The project aims to develop a computer vision model that can
identify different types of fish and analyze their capture duration
by analyzing their eye images. Additionally, the model is designed
to provide market price averages based on the identified fish
types.
# Objective 
- Develop a robust computer vision model for fish identification.
- Analyze eye images to estimate the capture duration of the fish accurately.
- Provide market price information for identified fish types.
# Data Sources
- Image Dataset: Images collected through on-site photography during visits to the local fish market. This ensures a firsthand and diverse representation of various fish species in the market ,In addition to some Images from the Internet.
- Market Data: Pricing information obtained individually from the local fish market during each visit. This includes the cost of different fish species, allowing for real-time market insights.
