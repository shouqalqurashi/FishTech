# T5-Bootcamp  - Capstone Project  
# Project Idea 
The project aims to develop a computer vision model that can
identify different types of fish and analyze their capture duration
by analyzing their eye images. Additionally, the model is designed
to provide market price averages based on the identified fish
types.
